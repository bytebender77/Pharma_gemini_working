Many scientists believe that colon and rectal cancers develop from polyps (tumors of the lining of the large bowel). This study will test whether a high-legume diet can reduce levels of certain factors (blood insulin, blood glucose, and markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein) that at elevated level",
